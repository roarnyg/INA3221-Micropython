============

Micropython driver for the Texas Instruments' INA3221 3 channels current sensor.
Product page at `ti.com <http://www.ti.com/product/INA3221>`_.

I absolutely need help for porting this library to Micropyhton. All help is appreciated!

The micropython files named ina3221_micropython.py and ina3221example.py are under heavy development and will hopefully be working with some help from you?

This driver is based on https://github.com/barbudor/CircuitPython_INA3221 barbudor_ina3221.lite.
